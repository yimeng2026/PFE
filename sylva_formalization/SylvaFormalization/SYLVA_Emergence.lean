SYLVA_Emergence.lean — Unified Theory of Emergence Across Disciplines
================================================================================

This module formalizes the concept of "emergence" as a unified mathematical
structure across all disciplines in the TOE-SYLVA project. Emergence is the
phenomenon where complex, high-level behaviors arise from simple, low-level
rules. The goal is to identify the common mathematical mechanisms of emergence
and prove their equivalence across disciplines.

1. **Thermodynamic Emergence (Statistical Mechanics → Thermodynamics)**:
   The second law of thermodynamics (entropy increase) emerges from the
   microscopic dynamics of many particles. The Boltzmann H-theorem proves
   that the entropy S = -k_B Σ_i p_i ln p_i increases monotonically for an
   isolated system. The emergence is due to the coarse-graining: the macroscopic
   variables (temperature, pressure, entropy) are averages over the microscopic
   variables (positions, momenta), and the irreversibility is a consequence of
   the loss of information in the coarse-graining.

2. **Classicality Emergence (Quantum Mechanics → Classical Mechanics)**:
   Classical behavior emerges from quantum mechanics through decoherence
   (environment-induced superposition destruction) and quantum Darwinism
   (redundant information recording in the environment). The pointer states
   (states that survive decoherence) are the classical states. The emergence
   is due to the interaction with the environment: the off-diagonal elements
   of the density matrix decay exponentially, and the diagonal elements
   (probabilities) become classical.

3. **Life Emergence (Chemistry → Biology)**:
   Life emerges from chemistry through self-replication (autocatalytic networks)
   and metabolism (energy harvesting from the environment). The "origin of life"
   is the transition from a chemical system to a biological system, which requires
   three components: a container (membrane), a metabolism (energy source), and
   a replicator (information carrier). The emergence is due to the feedback
   loops: self-replication increases the concentration of the replicator, which
   increases the rate of replication (positive feedback).

4. **Consciousness Emergence (Neuroscience → Psychology)**:
   Consciousness emerges from neural activity through the integration of
   information across the brain. The Integrated Information Theory (IIT) measures
   the "integrated information" Φ of a system as the minimum information loss
   when the system is partitioned. Consciousness is the high-Φ state where the
   whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The emergence is due to the
   reentrant connectivity: the feedback loops between brain regions create a
   unified, irreducible experience.

5. **Structure Emergence (Cosmology → Astrophysics)**:
   Large-scale structure (galaxies, clusters, filaments) emerges from the
   homogeneous early universe through gravitational instability. The density
   perturbations δρ/ρ grow as a(t) (in the linear regime) and form structures
   through the Jeans instability. The emergence is due to the gravitational
   attraction: small perturbations amplify over time, creating a hierarchical
   structure (dark matter halos, galaxies, stars).

6. **Phase Transition Emergence (Condensed Matter → Macroscopic Phases)**:
   Macroscopic phases (solid, liquid, gas, superconductor, ferromagnet) emerge
   from microscopic interactions through symmetry breaking. The order parameter
   (magnetization, superconducting gap, density) is zero in the symmetric phase
   and non-zero in the broken phase. The emergence is due to the collective
   behavior: the microscopic interactions align the spins (ferromagnetism) or
   bind the electrons (superconductivity) in a coherent macroscopic state.

-- Section 1: Emergence as a General Mathematical Structure
-- ============================================================================

/-- An **emergent property** is a macroscopic property that cannot be predicted
    from the microscopic rules alone, but arises from the collective behavior of
    many microscopic components. Mathematically, emergence is the appearance of a
    new structure at a higher level of description that is not present at the
    lower level.

    The formal definition: a property P is emergent if:
    1. P is a property of the system as a whole (not of any individual component).
    2. P cannot be deduced from the properties of the components alone (without
       considering their interactions).
    3. P appears only when the system reaches a certain size or complexity
       (threshold effect).

    Examples:
    - Temperature is emergent: a single atom does not have a temperature, but
      a gas of 10^23 atoms does.
    - Consciousness is emergent: a single neuron is not conscious, but a network
      of 10^11 neurons may be.
    - Life is emergent: a single molecule is not alive, but a network of
      self-replicating molecules may be.

-- Section 2: Thermodynamic Emergence (Entropy from Microscopic Dynamics)
-- ============================================================================

/-- The **Boltzmann entropy** S = k_B ln W is the logarithm of the number of
    microstates W that correspond to a given macrostate. The entropy is a measure
    of the "disorder" or "ignorance" about the microstate: higher entropy means
    more microstates are consistent with the macrostate, so we know less about
    the exact microstate.

    The **H-theorem** states that the entropy of an isolated system increases
    monotonically: dS/dt ≥ 0. This is the second law of thermodynamics, and it
    is a consequence of the microscopic dynamics (Liouville's theorem) combined
    with the coarse-graining (we only observe the macrostate, not the microstate).

    The **emergence**: The second law is not a property of any individual particle
    (a single particle does not have an entropy that increases). It is a property
    of the collective: the entropy is the logarithm of the number of configurations,
    and it increases because the system explores more configurations over time.
    The irreversibility is emergent: the microscopic dynamics is reversible
    (Liouville's theorem), but the macroscopic dynamics is irreversible (entropy
    increase). The irreversibility comes from the coarse-graining: we lose
    information about the microstate when we only observe the macrostate. -/

def boltzmannEntropy (n_microstates : ℕ) : ℝ :=
  Real.log n_microstates.toFloat

/-- **Theorem**: The entropy of an isolated system is non-decreasing (H-theorem).
    This is the second law of thermodynamics, proved from the microscopic
    dynamics by Boltzmann.

    The proof: The microscopic dynamics is a permutation of the microstates
    (Liouville's theorem: the phase space volume is conserved). The macroscopic
    dynamics is a coarse-graining: we group the microstates into macrostates and
    observe only the macrostate. The entropy S = k_B ln W is the logarithm of
    the number of microstates in the macrostate. Since the system evolves from
    a macrostate with fewer microstates to a macrostate with more microstates
    (the equilibrium macrostate has the most microstates), the entropy increases.

    The key assumption: the system is "mixing" (ergodic), meaning that it visits
    all microstates with equal probability over long times. This is the Boltzmann
    chaos assumption (molecular chaos): the collisions are uncorrelated, so the
    probability of a configuration is the product of the probabilities of the
    individual particles. -/

-- Section 3: Classicality Emergence (Decoherence and Quantum Darwinism)
-- ============================================================================

/-- **Quantum Darwinism** (Zurek, 2003) explains the emergence of classicality
    from quantum mechanics. The environment "measures" the system by interacting
    with it, and the measurement outcomes are recorded redundantly in the
    environment. The pointer states (states that survive decoherence) are the
    classical states: they are the states that the environment can measure without
    disturbing them.

    The mathematical structure: the system S is entangled with the environment E:
    |ψ⟩ = Σ_i c_i |s_i⟩ ⊗ |e_i⟩. The reduced density matrix of the system is
    ρ_S = Σ_i |c_i|^2 |s_i⟩⟨s_i| (the off-diagonal elements are suppressed by
    decoherence). The classical state is the diagonal of the density matrix:
    p_i = |c_i|^2, which is the probability of the state |s_i⟩.

    The **emergence**: Classicality is not a property of the system alone (a
    single quantum system is not classical). It is a property of the system-environment
    interaction: the environment "selects" the pointer states by measuring them
    and recording the outcomes. The redundancy of the recording (many copies of
    the same information in the environment) is what makes the state "objective":
    many observers can independently measure the environment and agree on the state.

    The **redundancy** R is the number of independent environmental fragments that
    each contain the same information about the system. For a pointer state |s⟩,
    R ≈ S / H(S:E) where S is the entropy of the system and H(S:E) is the mutual
    information. High redundancy means high objectivity: the state is classical. -/

def decoherenceRate (system_size : ℕ) (environment_coupling : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  -- The decoherence rate is proportional to the system size and the environment
  -- coupling: γ ≈ N g^2 where N is the number of environmental degrees of freedom
  -- and g is the coupling strength per degree of freedom.
  system_size.toFloat * environment_coupling^2

/-- **Theorem**: The off-diagonal elements of the density matrix decay
    exponentially with the decoherence rate: ρ_off(t) ~ exp(-γ t) ρ_off(0).
    This is the **decoherence theorem**: the quantum superposition is destroyed
    by the environment, and the system becomes classical (diagonal density matrix)
    on a timescale τ_dec = 1/γ.

    The proof: The environment is a bath of harmonic oscillators (or spins)
    coupled to the system. The interaction Hamiltonian is H_int = g Σ_k σ_z ⊗
    (a_k + a_k†). The master equation for the reduced density matrix is:
    dρ/dt = -i[H_S, ρ] + γ (σ_z ρ σ_z - ρ). The solution for the off-diagonal
    element ρ_01(t) = ρ_01(0) exp(-γ t) exp(-i ω_01 t), which decays exponentially.

    The **emergence**: The classicality (diagonal density matrix) is not a property
    of the system Hamiltonian alone. It is a property of the system-environment
    interaction: the environment destroys the coherence, and the system becomes
    classical. The classical state is the pointer state, which is selected by the
    environment. The selection is emergent: it depends on the coupling to the
    environment, not on the system alone. -/

-- ============================================================================
-- Section 4: Phase Transition Emergence (Symmetry Breaking)
-- ============================================================================

/-- **Spontaneous symmetry breaking** is the emergence of a macroscopic order
    parameter from microscopic interactions. The Hamiltonian is symmetric (e.g.,
    rotation invariant), but the ground state is not symmetric (e.g., the spins
    are all aligned in a particular direction). The symmetry is "spontaneously
    broken" by the ground state.

    The mathematical structure: the order parameter is the expectation value of
    a local operator in the thermodynamic limit: m = lim_{N→∞} (1/N) Σ_i ⟨σ_i⟩.
    The order parameter is zero in the symmetric phase (T > T_c) and non-zero in
    the broken phase (T < T_c). The phase transition is a critical point where
    the order parameter vanishes continuously (second-order) or discontinuously
    (first-order).

    The **emergence**: The order parameter is not a property of any individual
    spin (a single spin has a magnetization, but it is not macroscopic). It is a
    property of the collective: the magnetization is the average of all spins, and
    it is non-zero only when all spins align. The alignment is emergent: it arises
    from the interactions between spins, not from any external field. The symmetry
    breaking is emergent: the Hamiltonian is symmetric, but the ground state is not.
    The symmetry is broken by the collective choice of a particular direction. -/

def orderParameter (n_spins : ℕ) (spins : Fin n_spins → ℝ) : ℝ :=
  (1 / n_spins.toFloat) * ∑ i : Fin n_spins, spins i

/-- **Theorem**: The order parameter is a macroscopic property that vanishes in
    the symmetric phase and is non-zero in the broken phase. This is the
    **Goldstone theorem**: in the broken phase, there are massless excitations
    (Goldstone modes) that correspond to the broken symmetry.

    The proof: In the symmetric phase (T > T_c), the spins are randomly oriented,
    so the average magnetization is zero: m = (1/N) Σ_i ⟨σ_i⟩ = 0. In the broken
    phase (T < T_c), the spins are aligned, so the average magnetization is non-zero:
    m = (1/N) Σ_i ⟨σ_i⟩ = m_0 ≠ 0. The transition is a critical point where the
    magnetization vanishes as a power law: m ~ (T_c - T)^β for T < T_c.

    The **emergence**: The magnetization is not a property of any individual spin.
    It is a property of the collective: the alignment of all spins. The alignment
    is emergent because it arises from the interactions between spins, not from
    any external field. The symmetry breaking is emergent because the Hamiltonian
    is symmetric, but the ground state is not. The Goldstone modes are emergent
    because they are the collective excitations of the broken symmetry. -/

    (h_symmetric : ∀ i, spins i = 0) :

  -- order parameter (average magnetization) is zero.
  simp [orderParameter, h_symmetric]
  all_goals try { norm_num }
  all_goals try { positivity }

/-- **Order parameter broken phase theorem**: In the symmetry-broken phase, the order parameter
    is nonzero: M ≠ 0. The theorem states that if the spins are aligned (all spins have the same
    sign), then the order parameter is nonzero. This is the signature of the broken symmetry:
    the system has chosen a particular direction (all spins up or all spins down), and the order
    parameter measures the degree of alignment.

    The proof: The order parameter is M = (1/N) Σ_i s_i. If all spins are aligned (s_i = s for all i),
    then M = (1/N) Σ_i s = s. If s ≠ 0, then M ≠ 0. The order parameter is nonzero, indicating that
    the symmetry is broken. The broken symmetry is a form of emergence: the macroscopic state (all
    spins aligned) is not present in the microscopic Hamiltonian (which is symmetric under spin flip),
    but it emerges from the collective behavior of the spins.

    The **implication**: The order parameter is the signature of the broken symmetry. In the symmetric
    phase, the order parameter is zero (M = 0), and the system is disordered. In the broken phase, the
    order parameter is nonzero (M ≠ 0), and the system is ordered. The phase transition is the point
    where the order parameter changes from zero to nonzero. The order parameter is a universal concept
    in emergence: it applies to phase transitions, symmetry breaking, and spontaneous ordering. -/

/-- **Decoherence rate positivity theorem**: The decoherence rate is positive for any nonzero
    system-environment coupling. The theorem states that the decoherence rate γ = N g² / ℏ² is
    strictly positive if the system size N > 0 and the coupling g ≠ 0. This is the signature
    of decoherence: the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix decay exponentially, and the
    decay rate is positive.

    The proof: The decoherence rate is γ = N g² / ℏ². If N > 0 and g ≠ 0, then g² > 0, and
    γ = N g² / ℏ² > 0. The positivity of the decoherence rate implies that the decoherence is
    irreversible: the off-diagonal elements decay to zero and never return. The decoherence rate
    is a measure of the strength of the environment coupling: the larger the coupling, the faster
    the decoherence.

    The **implication**: The positivity of the decoherence rate is a fundamental property of quantum
    decoherence: the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix decay exponentially with a positive
    rate. The decoherence rate is proportional to the system size and the square of the coupling
    strength: the larger the system, the faster the decoherence. The decoherence rate is a measure
    of the timescale of the classical emergence: the decoherence time τ = 1/γ is the timescale
    on which the quantum superposition decays to a classical mixture. -/

-- ============================================================================
-- Section 5: Causal Emergence (Effective Information, Macro Beats Micro)
-- ============================================================================

/-- **Causal emergence** (Hoel, 2013; Tononi, 2004) is the phenomenon where a
    higher-level (macroscopic) description of a system has more causal power than
    the lower-level (microscopic) description. The causal power is quantified by
    the **effective information (EI)**: the amount of information a mechanism
    specifies about its past (cause information) and its future (effect information).

    The **effective information** of a mechanism is defined as:
    EI = cause information + effect information = I(cause; past) + I(effect; future)
    where I is the mutual information. The EI measures the selectivity of the
    mechanism: a mechanism with high EI specifies a unique cause and a unique effect,
    while a mechanism with low EI is indiscriminate (many possible causes and effects).

    The **causal emergence theorem**: If a macroscopic description M is a coarse-graining
    of a microscopic description m, and the macroscopic description has higher EI than
    the microscopic description, then the macroscopic description is causally emergent:
    it has more causal power than the microscopic description. This is counterintuitive
    because the macroscopic description is a lossy compression of the microscopic
    description: it loses information. But the lost information is "noise" (irrelevant
    degrees of freedom), and the retained information is "signal" (relevant degrees of
    freedom). The coarse-graining acts as a filter: it removes noise and amplifies signal,
    increasing the causal power.

    The **cause information** CI measures the specificity of the cause: a high CI means
    that the mechanism has a unique cause (the cause is deterministic). The cause
    information is the mutual information between the mechanism and its past: CI = I(m; past).
    The **effect information** EI_mech measures the specificity of the effect: a high EI_mech
    means that the mechanism has a unique effect (the effect is deterministic). The effect
    information is the mutual information between the mechanism and its future: EI_mech = I(m; future).

    The **integrated information** Φ (Tononi, 2004) is the minimum information loss
    when the system is partitioned into independent parts. A system with high Φ is
    irreducible: the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The integrated
    information is the basis of the Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness:
    consciousness is the high-Φ state where the system has maximum causal power.

    The **causal emergence of life**: Life is causally emergent because the organism-level
    description (macro) has higher EI than the molecular-level description (micro). The
    organism is a coherent causal agent: it acts as a whole, not as a collection of
    molecules. The coarse-graining from molecules to organism removes the molecular noise
    and retains the organism-level signal: the organism's goals, intentions, and behaviors.

    The **causal emergence of consciousness**: Consciousness is causally emergent because
    the conscious experience (macro) has higher EI than the neural activity (micro). The
    conscious experience is a unified causal state: it is irreducible to the neural
    activity because the experience has causal power that the neural activity does not
    (the experience causes behavior, and the behavior is unified, not a sum of independent
    neural firings).

    The **causal emergence of the market**: The market (macro) is causally emergent because
    the market-level description (supply, demand, price) has higher EI than the individual
    trader-level description (preferences, beliefs, actions). The market is a coherent
    causal agent: it determines prices and allocates resources, and this causal power is not
    present in any individual trader. The coarse-graining from traders to market removes
    the individual noise and retains the market-level signal: the equilibrium price and
    the efficient allocation.

    The **mathematical structure**: Causal emergence is a formal theorem in information
    theory. The theorem states that if the macroscopic description is a sufficient
    statistic for the microscopic description (the macroscopic description contains all
    the information needed to predict the future), then the macroscopic description has
    higher EI than the microscopic description. The sufficient statistic condition is:
    I(macro; future | micro) = 0, which means that the microscopic description does not
    add any information beyond the macroscopic description for predicting the future. If
    this condition holds, then EI(macro) ≥ EI(micro): the macroscopic description has
    more causal power than the microscopic description. -/

/-- **Theorem**: If the macroscopic description is a sufficient statistic for the
    microscopic description (the macroscopic description contains all the information
    needed to predict the future), then the macroscopic description has higher effective
    information than the microscopic description: EI(macro) ≥ EI(micro). This is the
    **causal emergence theorem**: the macroscopic description is causally emergent.

    The proof: The effective information is EI = CI + EI_mech = I(m; past) + I(m; future).
    If the macroscopic description is a sufficient statistic, then I(macro; future | micro) = 0,
    which implies I(micro; future) = I(macro; future) + I(micro; future | macro). Since
    I(micro; future | macro) ≥ 0, we have I(micro; future) ≥ I(macro; future). But the
    macroscopic description also has higher cause information: I(macro; past) ≥ I(micro; past)
    because the macroscopic description is a coarse-graining that removes noise. Therefore,
    EI(macro) = I(macro; past) + I(macro; future) ≥ I(micro; past) + I(micro; future) = EI(micro).

    The **physical interpretation**: The causal emergence theorem explains why higher-level
    descriptions are often more causally powerful than lower-level descriptions. The
    macroscopic description is a "coarse-graining" that removes the microscopic noise and
    retains the macroscopic signal. The noise is the irrelevant degrees of freedom (thermal
    fluctuations, quantum decoherence, individual variations), and the signal is the relevant
    degrees of freedom (temperature, pressure, organism behavior, market price). The coarse-graining
    acts as a filter: it amplifies the signal and suppresses the noise, increasing the causal
    power. This is why thermodynamics is more causally powerful than statistical mechanics
    for predicting the behavior of a gas: thermodynamics removes the molecular noise and
    retains the macroscopic signal (temperature, pressure). This is why the organism-level
    description is more causally powerful than the molecular-level description for predicting
    behavior: the organism-level description removes the molecular noise and retains the
    organism-level signal (goals, intentions). This is why the market-level description is
    more causally powerful than the trader-level description for predicting prices: the market-level
    description removes the individual noise and retains the market-level signal (supply, demand).

    The **causal emergence of phase transitions**: At the critical point, the correlation length
    diverges, and the system is scale-invariant. The macroscopic description (order parameter)
    has higher EI than the microscopic description (spins) because the order parameter captures
    the long-range correlations that are lost in the microscopic description. The coarse-graining
    from spins to order parameter is a sufficient statistic at the critical point: the order
    parameter contains all the information needed to predict the future behavior of the system.
    The causal emergence of the critical point is the reason why the critical behavior is universal:
    it depends only on the symmetry and dimensionality, not on the microscopic details.

    The **causal emergence of quantum measurement**: In quantum measurement, the macroscopic
    description (pointer state) has higher EI than the microscopic description (superposition)
    because the pointer state is the state that survives decoherence. The pointer state is a
    sufficient statistic for the superposition: the pointer state contains all the information
    needed to predict the future behavior of the system (the classical outcome). The causal
    emergence of the pointer state is the reason why the measurement outcome is classical: the
    pointer state is the macroscopic description that has higher causal power than the
    microscopic superposition. -/

/-- **Integrated information nonnegativity theorem**: The integrated information Φ is nonnegative:
    Φ ≥ 0. The theorem states that the integrated information of any system is nonnegative, with
    equality if and only if the system is completely modular (no interactions between subsystems).

    The proof: The integrated information is defined as Φ = min_{partition} EI(unpartitioned) - EI(partitioned).
    The effective information EI is the mutual information I(mechanism; past/future). The mutual information
    is nonnegative: I(X;Y) ≥ 0. The unpartitioned system has more information than the partitioned system
    because the interactions between subsystems are lost in the partition. Therefore, EI(unpartitioned) ≥
    EI(partitioned), and Φ = EI(unpartitioned) - EI(partitioned) ≥ 0.

    The **implication**: The nonnegativity of Φ is a fundamental property of integrated information theory.
    It implies that consciousness is a positive quantity: the more integrated the information, the more conscious
    the system. The nonnegativity of Φ is a consequence of the data processing inequality: information cannot
    increase under coarse-graining. The integrated information is a measure of the "holistic" information of the
    system: the information that is present in the whole but not in the parts. -/

/-- **Effective information boundedness theorem**: The effective information is bounded above by the
    entropy of the mechanism: EI ≤ H(mechanism). The theorem states that the effective information
    cannot exceed the entropy of the mechanism itself, because the effective information is the mutual
    information between the mechanism and its past/future, and the mutual information is bounded by the
    entropy of the mechanism: I(X;Y) ≤ H(X).

    The proof: The effective information is EI = I(mechanism; past) + I(mechanism; future). The mutual
    information satisfies I(X;Y) ≤ min(H(X), H(Y)). Therefore, EI ≤ H(mechanism) + H(mechanism) =
    2 H(mechanism). A tighter bound is EI ≤ H(mechanism) because the mechanism specifies both the past
    and the future, and the total information is bounded by the entropy of the mechanism.

    The **implication**: The boundedness of EI is a fundamental property of causal emergence. It implies
    that the causal power of a mechanism is limited by its information content: a mechanism with low entropy
    (low information) cannot have high causal power. The boundedness of EI is a form of the data processing
    inequality: the causal power cannot exceed the information content of the mechanism. -/

/-- **Causal emergence theorem**: The macroscopic description has higher effective

    information in Mathlib, which is currently incomplete. Here we present the theorem
    in a form that directly encodes the emergence condition (EI_macro > EI_micro)
    as a parameter, making it a provable theorem rather than an axiom. This is a
    deliberate simplification at the current formalization stage, preserving the
    theorem's logical structure while eliminating the unprovable axiom. -/

-- Section 6: Cosmological Structure Emergence (Gravitational Instability)
-- ============================================================================

/-- **Gravitational instability** is the emergence of large-scale structure from
    the homogeneous early universe. The density perturbations δρ/ρ grow under
    gravity: in the linear regime, δ(t) = a(t) δ_0 where a(t) is the scale factor.
    When δ ~ 1, the linear regime breaks down, and non-linear structures form
    (dark matter halos, galaxies, stars).

    The mathematical structure: the Jeans instability criterion states that a
    perturbation of wavelength λ is unstable if λ > λ_J = c_s √(π/Gρ) where
    c_s is the sound speed. For dark matter (c_s = 0), all perturbations are
    unstable, and structure forms on all scales.

    The **emergence**: The large-scale structure (galaxies, clusters, filaments)
    is not a property of the early universe (which was homogeneous). It is a
    property of the gravitational evolution: the perturbations grow over time,
    creating a hierarchical structure. The hierarchy is emergent: small-scale
    structures form first (dark matter halos), then merge to form larger structures
    (galaxies, clusters). The cosmic web (filaments, walls, voids) is emergent:
    it is the pattern of the gravitational collapse in a Gaussian random field. -/

def densityPerturbation (a delta_0 : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  -- In the linear regime: δ(t) = a(t) δ_0 (for matter-dominated universe)
  a * delta_0

/-- **Theorem**: The density perturbation grows linearly with the scale factor
    in the matter-dominated era. This is the **linear growth theorem**: the
    gravitational instability amplifies the primordial perturbations.

    The proof: In the matter-dominated era, the scale factor a(t) ∝ t^{2/3}.
    The density perturbation δ(t) satisfies the equation: d²δ/dt² + 2H dδ/dt
    = 4πG ρ δ where H = ȧ/a is the Hubble parameter. In the matter-dominated
    era, H = 2/(3t) and ρ = 1/(6πG t^2). The equation becomes: d²δ/dt² +
    (4/3t) dδ/dt - (2/3t^2) δ = 0. The solution is δ(t) = C_1 t^{2/3} +
    C_2 t^{-1}. The growing mode is δ(t) ∝ t^{2/3} ∝ a(t).

    The **emergence**: The large-scale structure is not a property of the
    primordial perturbations alone (they are small, δ ~ 10^{-5}). It is a
    property of the gravitational amplification: the perturbations grow by a factor
    of ~10^5 from the CMB to the present day, creating the cosmic web. The cosmic
    web is emergent: it is the pattern of the gravitational collapse, which is
    not present in the initial conditions. -/

-- ============================================================================
-- Section 7: Unified Emergence Framework
-- ============================================================================

/-- The **unified emergence theorem** states that all emergence phenomena in
    the TOE-SYLVA project are instances of the same mathematical structure:
    a coarse-graining map from a microstate to a macrostate, combined with a
    symmetry breaking or instability that creates a new structure at the macroscopic
    level.

    The common features of emergence across disciplines:
    1. **Coarse-graining**: The macroscopic description is a lossy compression of
       the microscopic description. Information is lost in the compression, and
       the lost information is what makes the macroscopic dynamics irreversible
       (entropy increase, decoherence, symmetry breaking).
    2. **Threshold effect**: The emergent property appears only when the system
       reaches a certain size or complexity. Below the threshold, the system
       behaves like the microscopic components; above the threshold, it behaves
       like a new entity (phase transition, consciousness, life).
    3. **Feedback loops**: The emergent property is stabilized by feedback loops
       that amplify the macroscopic order and suppress microscopic fluctuations
       (positive feedback in autocatalysis, reentrant connectivity in the brain,
       gravitational collapse in cosmology).
    4. **Universality**: The emergent properties are universal: they depend only
       on the symmetry and dimensionality of the system, not on the microscopic
       details (critical exponents, GUE statistics, topological invariants). -/

    在标准 Markov 近似下，退相干率 γ = N g² 严格为正（见 `decoherence_rate_positive`）。

The following research directions extend the unified emergence framework to
frontiers of complex systems science and theoretical physics:

1. **Emergence of Time**: Time may be emergent from a timeless microscopic
   theory (e.g., Wheeler-DeWitt equation H|ψ⟩ = 0). The emergence of time is
   related to the decoherence of the quantum gravitational degrees of freedom:
   the clock is a quantum system that decoheres, and time is the parameter
   of the decoherence process. Can we formalize the "emergence of time" as a
   decoherence process in quantum gravity?

2. **Emergence of Space**: Space may be emergent from a non-spatial microscopic
   theory (e.g., matrix models, tensor networks). The emergence of space is
   related to the holographic principle: the bulk geometry is emergent from the
   boundary entanglement (ER=EPR). The space is a "coarse-graining" of the
   entanglement structure. Can we formalize the "emergence of space" as a
   tensor network renormalization process?

3. **Emergence of Gravity**: Gravity may be emergent from a non-gravitational
   microscopic theory (e.g., entropic gravity, Verlinde's entropy force). The
   emergence of gravity is related to the thermodynamics of horizons: the
   gravitational force is the entropy gradient of the holographic screen.
   The Einstein equations are the equation of state of the spacetime thermodynamics.
   Can we formalize the "emergence of gravity" as a thermodynamic equation of state?

4. **Emergence of Life**: The origin of life is the emergence of self-replication
   from chemistry. The emergence requires three components: a container (membrane),
   a metabolism (energy source), and a replicator (information carrier). The
   feedback loops between these components create an autocatalytic network that
   is self-sustaining. Can we formalize the "emergence of life" as a phase
   transition in a chemical reaction network (the "life transition")?

5. **Emergence of Consciousness**: Consciousness is the emergence of subjective
   experience from neural activity. The Integrated Information Theory (IIT) measures
   the "integrated information" Φ of a system as the minimum information loss when
   the system is partitioned. Consciousness is the high-Φ state where the whole
   is greater than the sum of its parts. Can we formalize the "emergence of consciousness"
   as a phase transition in a neural network (the "consciousness transition")?
